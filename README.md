# 📊 Improving Inventory Reporting Accuracy Through Data Standardization

## 📌 Business Problem
Inconsistent item naming across operational systems caused revenue underreporting and reporting ambiguity.

Management could not reliably answer:
“How much tenderloin was sold this month?”

---

## 🎯 Analytical Objective
Design a lightweight analytical standardization layer to enable accurate aggregation and reporting — without modifying operational workflows.

---

## 🛠 Approach
- Identified inconsistent item naming patterns
- Created a mapping layer to standardize commercial cuts
- Compared baseline vs standardized reporting outputs
- Quantified revenue reporting differences

Tools: Spreadsheet aggregation, SQL-style joins

---

## 🔍 Key Insight
Prior to standardization, tenderloin sales were materially underreported.

After introducing an analytical mapping layer:
- Reporting ambiguity was resolved
- True revenue visibility improved
- No operational disruption required
